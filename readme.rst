Benchmark Repository
====================

This is a repository for the specification of benchmarks, a 
database of recipes used in benchmarks, and scripts to translate the 
specifications and recipes into Cyclus input files.

Specification Format
--------------------

The fuel cycle simulation benchmark input specification format is described in
detail below. The specification is split into three sections: materials,
describing the materials to be used in the simulation; facilities, describing
the facilities that will act in the simulation; and fuel cycle, describing the
behavior of the fuel cycle during the simulation (e.g., when certain types of
facilities become available). Each section includes an optional metadata
structure. The purpose of this structure is to provide additional information,
including simulator-specific information. A classic example is that of fuel
assembly geometry, described in [BOUCHER07]_, which could be included in the
metadata of a reactor facility. In general, we try to prescribe to the examples
laid forth in other specification languages in computational nuclear science
(e.g. [MATTOON12]_). We are additionally guided by this work when arbitrary
decisions must be made, e.g., using camelCase instead of other ways to write
compound_words.

The specifications provided below have three main sections (in general). The
first is metadata. Metadata sections exist purely to provide additional
information not required by the specification (but information that's nice to
have anyway). By definition, metadata should be able to be ignored without
losing information critical to the full specification. Following metadata is an
attributes section. The attributes for a given object (e.g. material, facility)
define the object's *state space*, i.e., the information that makes that object
what it is. Finally, the constraints section defines constraints placed on the
object's state space. For example, an object could be defined by a single
integer (its attribute) which is constrained to a range of [0,5].

Materials
+++++++++

A 'materials specification' defines the isotopic makeup of material in a fuel
cycle simulation. For the purposes of benchmarks, isotopic definitions generally
come in two flavors: prescribed recipes or process-defined isotopic vectors. A
predefined recipes is straightforward, and an example of this is unirradiated
uranium. Natural uranium's isotopics are well known (within deviations in
natural abundances), and the enrichment process can be modeled with simple
analytical equations. Accordingly, precise isotopic recipes can be provided for
such materials. During and after irradiation, however, complex physical models
are required to obtain precise isotopic compositions; the current best practice
for the majority of models is to perform such calculations offline (i.e., not
within a simulation). Accordingly, certain factual statements can be made based
on domain-level knowledge to place restrictions or constraints on a defined
material, but precisely defining the isotopic makeup of material
post-irradiation is generally not applicable.

We define the materials specification as follows: ::

   * materials
     * name1
       * metadata (optional)
      	 * suggestedComposition (optional)
           * isotope1
           * isotope2
       * attributes
      	 * recipe
           * true/false
         * parents (optional)
       * constraints
       	 * constraint1
       	 * constraint2...
     * name2...

This specifications covers both cases described above. If a material is
process-defined (i.e., it is not a recipe), the suggestedComposition structure
allows for the benchmark to provide a "hint" as to what the processed
composition might be. Such a structure covers the majority of benchmark cases
where single-burnup compositions are provided, e.g. 45 GWd/tHM UOX. 

The constraints section provides requirements that materials must meet. If the
material can be described as a recipe, then isotope-isotopic fraction pairs
(i.e., strict equality constraints) can be provided to fully specify the
material. If the material is process-defined, then inequalities can be used to
define the material. Density, or any other material property, is specified in
the constraints section. 

The parents field allows for related materials to be specified in a more compact
manner. Any child materials incorporate both their prescribed constraints as
well as the constraints of their parents. 

Two examples of the material specification implemented in JSON are provided
below ::

      "leu": {
          "attributes": {
              "recipe": true
          },
          "constraints": [      
              ["U235", 0.0495],
              ["U238", 0.9505],
              ["O16", 2.0],
              ["density", 10.2]
          ]
      },
      "spent_pwr_uox": {
          "metadata": {
              "suggestedComposition": [
                  ["U235",0.02],
                  ...
              ]
	  },
          "attributes": {
              "recipe": false
          },
          "constraints": [
              "id == 92235 && x < 0.0495",
              "id == 92238 && x < 0.9505",
              "density < 10.2"
          ]
      }

Facilities
++++++++++

A 'facility specification' provides a minimal definition to determine the
working behavior of facilities, e.g. reactors and separations facilities, in a
simulation. There are members of the specification common to all facilities,
including a classification (i.e., type), a name, a lifetime, and input and
output materials. Of course, different facilities are defined by different
parameters, so each class of facility must have a unique
specification. Presented herein is a proof-of-principle draft with suggestions
for how to specify certain facilities. It is not exhaustive, and comments and
suggestions for improvements are certainly welcome.

In general, the specification provides a description of each parameter (i.e.,
its units) in the attributes section and a definition of each parameter (i.e.,
its value) in the constraints section.

For completeness, the facility specification section is defined as follows: ::

   * facilities
     * facilitySpecification1
     * facilitySpecification2...

The exact facility specification depends on the class of facility. The selected
facilities specifications which are supported at the present time are described
below.

Reactors
~~~~~~~~

The current specification assumes that reactors have defined core fuel zones. In
the simplest case, e.g. a UOX LWR, there may be one zone. A more complicated
case would include a fast reactor that incorporates an axial and radial
blanket. 

We define the reactor specification as follows: ::

   * name
     * metadata (optional)
       * type: reactor
     * attributes
       * thermalPower: units
       * efficiency: units
       * cycleLegth: units
       * capacityFactor: units (required if cycleLength is given in EFPD)
       * lifetime: {units | distributed} 
       * fuelTypes: fuel1, fuel2..
       * batches: units, fuelTypes
       * coreLoading: units, fuelTypes
       * burnup: units, fuelTypes
       * coolingTime: units, fuelTypes
       * storageTime: units, fuelTypes
     * constraints
       * thermalPower: value
       * efficiency: value
       * cycleLegth: value
       * capacityFactor: value (required if cycleLength is given in EFPD)
       * batches: value
       * lifetime: {value | distributed}
       * batches: value, fuel1
       * batches: value, fuel2...
       * coreLoading: value, fuel1
       * coreLoading: value, fuel2...
       * burnup: value, fuel1
       * burnup: value, fuel2...
       * coolingTime: value, fuel1
       * coolingTime: value, fuel2...
       * storageTime: value, fuel1
       * storageTime: value, fuel2...
     * inputMaterials
     * outputMaterials

In this specification, the units member is a pair of values stating the data
type and units, for example::

  thermalPower: float, GWd/tHM

Some reactors utilize multiple kinds of fuels (e.g. fast reactors have different
fuel types between their cores and blankets). In such a case, one must
differentiate between certain parameters based on the fuel type, such as its
burnup, core loading amount, etc. The specification allows for this situation by
appending a fuelType specifier on the values of these parameters.

The lifetime member allows for one of two types of values. If specific units and
a value are given, then all facilities of the given class are assigned a
specific lifetime. If it instead flagged as a distribution, facility lifetimes
are inferred from the Fuel Cycle demand section. This is required of the
specification for now due to the method by which previous benchmarks have been
defined (i.e., defining a "facility life distribution curve" rather than
defining a demand for certain facilities -- see [BOUCHER07]_).

An example of the specification implemented in JSON is shown below: ::

     "lwr_reactor": {
     	 "metadata": {
	     "type":"reactor"
	 },
	 "attributes": {
	     "thermalPower": ["float", "GWt"],
	     "efficiency": ["float", "percent"],
	     "cycleLength": ["int", "month"],
	     "lifetime": ["int", "year"],
	     "fuels": ["leu"],
	     "batches": ["int", "", ["leu"]],
	     "coreLoading": ["float", "kg", ["leu"]],
	     "burnup": ["float", "GWd/tHM", ["leu"]],
	     "storageTime": ["int", "year", ["leu"]],
	     "coolingTime": ["int", "year", ["leu"]],
	 },
	 "constraints": [
	     ["thermalPower", 4.25],
	     ["efficiency", 34.1],
	     ["cycleLength", 12],
	     ["lifetime", 60],
	     ["batches", 3, "leu"],
	     ["coreLoading", 78.7, "leu"],
	     ["burnup", 60, "leu"],
	     ["storageTime", 2, "leu"],
	     ["coolingTime", 5, "leu"]
	 ],
	 "inputMaterials": ["leu"],
	 "outputMaterials": ["used_leu"]
     }

Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Repositories serve mostly as sinks for certain types of materials. Additional
fidelity can be provided by asserting a limit on the quantity or quality
(e.g. radiotoxicity or thermal heat load) of the entering materials. Accordingly,
a repository is specified as follows: ::

   * name
     * metadata (optional)
       * type: repository
     * attributes
       * capacity: units
       * lifetime: units
     * constraints
       * capacity: value
       * lifetime: value
     * inputMaterials

An example of a specification implemented in JSON is shown below: ::

     "lwr_repository": {
     	 "metadata: {
	     "type":"repository"
	 },
	 "attributes": {
	     "lifetime": ["int", "year"], 
	     "capacity": ["double", "tHM/year"]
	 },
	 "constraints": [
	     ["lifetime", 60], 
             ["capacity", 800.0]
	 ], 
	 "inputMaterials": ["used_leu"]
      }

Enrichment
~~~~~~~~~~

Enrichment facilities in simulations model the process of enriching
Uranium. There is generally a capacity associated with such a process denoted in
Separative Work Units (SWU). The process itself can be defined by the input
material used (e.g. natural uranium) and the weight fraction of U-235 in the
tails material (i.e., the un-enriched byproduct). As with all facilities, an
operational lifetime can also be assigned.

The specification for an enrichment facility is as follows: ::

   * name
     * metadata (optional)
       * type: enrichment
     * attributes
       * capacity: units
       * lifetime: units
       * tailsFraction: units
     * constraints
       * capacity: value
       * lifetime: value
       * tailsFraction: value
     * inputMaterials
     * outputMaterials

An example of a specification implemented in JSON is shown below: ::

     "lwr_enrichment": {
     	 "metadata: {
	     "type":"enrichment"
	 },
	 "attributes": {
	     "lifetime": ["int", "year"], 
	     "capacity": ["double", "SWU/year"],
	     "tailsFraction": ["double", "weight percent"]
	 },
	 "constraints": [
	     ["lifetime", 60], 
             ["capacity", 1e5]
	     ["tailsFraction", 0.03]
	 ], 
	 "inputMaterials": ["natl_u"],
	 "outputMaterials": ["leu", "tails"]
      }

Reprocessing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reprocessing plants are generally used in a simulation to recycle certain
elemental groups to be reused as fuel, separating valuable, fissile isotopes
(and their elemental family), from isotopes that act as neutron
poisons. Accordingly, reprocessing plants must specify some number of elemental
families and a corresponding separation efficiency. Furthermore, the facility is
defined by a processing capacity. 

A reprocessing facility is specified as follows: ::

   * name
     * metadata (optional)
       * type: reprocessing
     * attributes
       * capacityType: units
       * lifetime: units
       * separationClass1:
         * elements: elementSet
         * efficiency: units
       * separationClass2...
     * constraints
       * capacityType: value
       * lifetime: value
       * separationClass1:
	 * efficiency: value
       * separationClass2...
     * inputMaterials
     * outputMaterials

Advanced Fabrication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fabrication of advanced fuels, i.e., those using some amount of recycled
material is required to model advanced fuel cycles. These fabrication facilities
generally take some set of input separated elements and a filling fertile
material (e.g. natural or depleted uranium), and output one or more advanced
fuel types. The decision making algorithm to determine how much of each
constituent to send to the facility and how to construct a given fuel type is
generally simulation-engine specific. One can, however, specify connections and
capacities as has been done in prior sections. 

An advanced fabrication facility is specified as follows: ::

   * name
     * metadata (optional)
       * type: advanced fabrication
     * attributes
       * capacities
         * capacityType1: units
         * capacityType2: units
	 * ...
       * lifetime: units
     * constraints
       * capacities
         * capacityType1: value
         * capacityType2: value
	 * ...
       * lifetime: value
     * inputMaterials
     * outputMaterials

Fuel Cycle
++++++++++

A 'fuel cycle specification' defines the basic progression and facility
availability of a simulation. These parameters include the time period to be
simulated, the initial condition of the simulation, the growth of facilities
(i.e., the demand for such facilities), and the technological availability of
certain advanced facilities.

We define the fuel cycle specification as follows: ::
  
  * fuelCycle
    * metadata (optional)
    * attributes
      * grid: units
      * initialConditions:
	* facility1: number
	* facility2...
      * demands:
	* demand1: units, facilities
	* demand2...
    * constraints
      * grid: value
      * demand1:
        * grid: value
	* growth: description
      * demand2...
    * availableTechnologies (optional)
      * technology: period

In general, the attributes and constraints of the fuelCycle data structure are
pretty straightforward. Inclusive time periods as described as grids,
e.g. [0,100] describes a time period between 0 and 100 in a given unit. Facility
growth curves are described via demand data structures. Demand data structures
contain two state attributes, their units and the facilities that meet the given
demand. They are constrained by the time periods over which they span and the
description of their growth. Growth descriptors essentially describe piece-wise
functions. An example of a a linear piece-wise growth descriptor is specified as
follows: ::
  
  * growth:
    * type: linear
    * period1: 
      * startTime: value
      * startValue: value (optional)
      * slope: value
    * period2...

The period structure describes each piece-wise section of the growth function. A
starting value can be supplied if required. Because of the complexity required
to describe these demand curves, the constraints section for the fuel cycle is
implemented as a dictionary (i.e., an object in JSON).

An example implementation of the fuel cycle specification in JSON is given
below::

 "fuelCycle": {
     "attributes": {
         "grid": "year",
	 "initialConditions": {
	     "repository": 1,
	 },
	 "demands": {
	     "power": ["GWe", ["lwrReactor"]]
	 }
     }
     "constraints": {
         "grid": [0, 120],
         "demands": {
	     "power": {
	         "grid": [0,120],
	         "growth": {
		     "type": "linear",
		     "period1": {
		         "startTime": 0,
		         "startValue": 1000,
	                 "slope": 500
		     }
                 }
	     }
	 }
     }
 }
